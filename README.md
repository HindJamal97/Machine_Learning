# Machine_Learning
Given the CatsVsDogs dataset, with the use of Tensorflow 2 we need to develop different network architectures and training parameters, so that we can predict and correctly classify the image to their relative class. Note that we also need to estimate the risk using a 5-fold cross validation, by considering the zero-one loss.
